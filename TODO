- Change group calculation to compute all groups and subgroups.
  - This means implicit trees instead of explicit trees
  - No easy cap on number of groups now
  - Should simplify the restructuring process

- Compute mustplay

- Compute cell weights based on group connectivity

- Use MM to compute a set of pattern based weights.

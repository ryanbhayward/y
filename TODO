* one version of make_move (with boolean: bridge?)
* debugging: use git
*lots more to git

* arbitrary size board
* arbitrary game
* y gui ?
* tournaments ?
* move-to-front (faster?better?)
    keep sublist of cells with wins,
    move sublist to front
    shuffle front and back sublists separately
    ... implicitly pruning dead cells
    stronger, but less random: 
    ?? don't shuffle sublist after recently found winner...
* distance to win
* miai
* win lookahead in rollouts
* better move gen:
     certain number of pure MC
     then for every cell with some winner
         make move and report opponent win %
     pick move min opponent win %

Program to play Y. Based on Fuego library. 

----------
 Building
----------
Get the latest Fuego trunk version from sourceforge and build it
in a parallel directory to your y directory.

% svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/fuego/code/trunk fuego
% cd fuego
% autoreconf -i
% ./configure
% cd ..

Now build Y. 

% cd y
% autoreconf -i
% ./configure --with-fuego-root=[abs path to fuego build]

Executable is src/y.

---------
 Playing
---------
You can play from the command-line, but it's better to get HexGui and play
against it that way. You can get HexGui from github at:

  https://github.com/ryanbhayward/hexgui.git

Under the 'View' menu select the 'Y' mode.

------------
 Parameters
------------
The default parameters will not result in play that is very strong. The 
following three parameters can drastically increase performance, depending
upon your machine:

  max_time [10]     -- seconds per search, 30 or 60 is much stronger than 10. 
  num_threads [1]   -- eg, try 4 on a 4 core machine.
  max_memory [2gb]  -- try to use as much as your machine allows

The more threads and the longer the search, the more memory that is required.

Run the 'Search Parameters' option of Analyze Dialog to change these parameters
(if running from the command-line you can use the 'y_param' command to do so).

  use_livegfx [0]   -- set to non-zero if using gui to see what Y is thinking.
                       does not affect performance.
